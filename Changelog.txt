----------------------------

Bug   :  'Otis.ini file'

New   :  'Otis manual.pdf' included in zip file.

New   :  Added rdd driver LETODBF from Elchs (https://github.com/elchs/LetoDBf). (fork from Alexander Kresin LETODB.)
         This is really a excellent client server solution. Thanks Elchs.

Modif :  'Otis Dataset Manager'
         The RDD driver name is also saved in the dataset for each individual opened table.
         It is possible to use tables with a different RDD in the same dataset.
         ex. local files with RDD DBFCDX and LetoDBf files with RDD LETO.

Modif :  'Plugin mode'
         A lot of modifications for "Plugin mode" of Otis.lib.
         Please read included document 'Otis manual.pdf'.
         Some remarks in it are very important.

New   :  'Otis Dataset Manager'
         Settings menu.
         Used to define area numbers and LetoDbf server settings.

New   :  'Otis Dataset Manager'
         Update of columns 'F' filelock status,
         'F' file is locked or loaded in excl. mode

         'R+' multiple records are locked.

Bug   :  'Otis Dataset Manager'
         Otis exits with a error when you hit menu 'Remove Index' when there where no tables opened.

Bug   :  'Otis Dataset Manager'
         The table OTIS.DS.DBF could not be opened if another RDD was set than DBFCDX.
         We now use the VIA clause to open this table.

New   :  Some warning messages.

         Suggestion from 'Ivo Fritz Hasse' who asked to add "PT850".

New   :  Added RDD "SIXCDX".
         Complete list of rdds loaded, "DBFCDX", "DBFNTX", "DBFNSX", "SIXCDX".

Modif : Otis program icon has been changed. Much better i think.

Modif :  'Table Inspector'
         Otis show now the number of orders that are opened in the upper left label 'Orders (xx)'.
         No longer necessary to open the combobox to see how many orders are opened.

Modif :  'Table Inspector'
         'Delete key' could already be used to Delete/Recall a record but
         from this version this feature is only enabled if the checkbox 'Allow Edit' is checked.

Corr. :  'Table Inspector'
         Scope button and checkbox are disabled if there is no order/index selected.

Corr. :  'Table Inspector'
         The order combobox was not updated correctly when a new order tag was created.

Modif :  'Table Properties'
         Table Info text is reordered and some info is added, ex. used RDD driver.

Corr. :  'Index Manager'
         New index, the tag name can maximum be 10 characters.

Corr. :  'Index Manager'
         If one of the expressions failed a error message was displayed but afterwards
         Otis tried nevertheless to create the new order.



29-06-2020  : OTIS V1.00 b06
----------------------------
      New   : Otis main screen
              Added option 'AutoOpen' orderbag files.
              Attention only for CDX and NSX orderbag files. DBFNTX does not support this behaviour.
              This checkbox will be 'checked' automatically if you choose DBFCDX or DBFNSX
              and 'unchecked' if you choose DBFNTX.
              Suggestion from 'Ash S'.

      New   : 'Structure editor'
              Added a new button to clear the structure list.

      New   : 'Table Inspector'
              Define a 'ORDER SCOPE' for the current activated order.
              A scope can be set for each order individually.
              You can enable / disable it with the scope checkbox.
              When you want to clear a scope you have to reopen the scope editor form and use the 'Clear' button.
              When you change the order the scope for this order is restored and if it not empty the scope checkbox will be
              checked if there is a scope or unchecked if the scope is empty. A message is also displayed to remember
              you that a scope is set and that maybe not all records are displayed.

              ATTENTION : If you defined a scope but you change the checkbox to unchecked to temporary display all records
                          without a scope, the scope will be lost if you change the order.
              REMARK    : All scopes for all orders stay actif even if you close the 'Inspector' for a table.
                          Thus when you reopen the 'Table Inspector' for the same table all scopes are restored.

              Suggestion from 'Ash S'.

      New   : 'Table Inspector'
              A new checkbox 'FILELOCK' to place a file width lock until you uncheck it.
              This filelock is not released by copy past, append insert or any other operations.
              This can be usefull to prevent other instances to modify your table when you want to
              execute multiple operations for updating / modifying the table.
              Thus "while" and "between" your operations another instance can not modify the table.

              This option is automatically checked if the option EXCLUSIVE mode is checked.
              and can NOT be unchecked if the file was loaded in EXCLUSIVE mode.
              The filelock is released when you close the table inspector for the table.

              Remark : if a file is opened in shared mode (non exclusive) and even if this
              option is not activated a recordlock or filelock and unlock will be placed automatically
              before and after each operation like copy/paste/delete/recall, ...etc.
              The only difference is that when this option is 'checked' that the file stays
              all the time 'locked' until you uncheck it.

      New   :  'Table Inspector'
               New menus UP / DOWN.
               Permits to push down or pull up a record to the next or previous physical record position.
               It does a physical record swap. Only allowed when no order is actif.

      Modif : 'Table Inspector'
              Some menus have been repositionned to regroup record and file width operations.

      Modif : 'Table Inspector'
               The Copy / Paste menus copies and paste only data for visible columns (thus fields).
               This permits to copy only certain fields from one record to another.
               Uncheck 'Hide Columns' if all data from a record has to be copied / pasted.

      Modif : Otis main screen
              Menu 'Table properties' has moved up, it is now just below menu 'Table Inspector'
              I think it has a better place there.

      Modif : 'Table Inspector' sub menu 'Index Manager'
              When you create a new order, the filename is automatically filled with a full path filename.
              It takes the name of the orderbag file that is selected in the index info table so you can easily
              add a new tag to it.
              If there are no orders at all and you want to create the first one, than the orderbag name
              is the same as the table name so you can open it later on with the 'AutoOpen' feature.

      BUG   : 'Structure editor'
              1. click 'Modify' or double click on a field name to modify a properties of a field
              2. change a property like type, len but don't change the fieldname
              3. Otis refused to save the modifications with error message "Fieldname exists already".

26-06-2020  : OTIS V1.00 b05
----------------------------
      New   : 'Table Properties'
              Added a button to copy the structure to the clipboard.
              Asked by 'Paul Schlicher'.

      Modif : 'Structure Editor'
              added (*.* All files) when you want to load
              the structure of a existing dbf table. For the same reason as below.
              Some users change the extension '.dbf' to by example '.dat'.

      Bug   : Otis exits with a error when we tried to load a dataset selected in the
              most used combobox list that DID NOT EXIST ANYMORE.

25-06-2020  : OTIS V1.00 b04
----------------------------
      Modif : Some users rename there ".DBF" to another extension ex. ".DAT"
              Otis no longer verifies if the extension is ".DBF".
              Any file can be loaded know.
              I use error trapping everywhere with "Try and Catch" so if
              a non dbf file is loaded a error message will be displayed.
              Asked by 'Daniele Federico'.

      Modif : Also added (*.* All files) when you want to load a index file.
              By default Otis proposes the extension of the default RDD driver in use.
              Attention, you can not load by example a .ntx file if you set DBFCDX
              as default driver. A error message will be displayed in that case.

25-06-2020  : OTIS V1.00 b03
----------------------------
      Added : Function DESCEND() is added as a EXTERNAL.
              This function is sometimes used in a index KEY expression.
              Otis refused to open the index file.
              Problem reported by 'Marcelo Brigatti'.

23-06-2020  : OTIS V1.00 b02
----------------------------
      Added : RDD driver selection combobox :
              DBFCDX, DBFNTX, DBFNSX

22-06-2020  : OTIS V1.00 b01
----------------------------
      First public release.


31/03/2020  : Developpement started on 31/03/2020 while
              the world was fighting the Corona virus.
